<p>This project was made to demonstrate the basic functions of cloud storage using blobs and queues.  The project originally was made for Microsoft's Azure but has been modified and refactored to make use of Amazon's AWS as well.  To get started you will ned:</p>

<pre><code>1.  An active Azure or AWS account.
2.  Basic knowledge of blobs (containers and/or buckets) and queues.
3.  The account key(s) for your Azure or AWS account.
</code></pre>

<p>You will be creating an account on a website I've made using .NET MVC that can store multiple storage account credentials for both Azure and/or AWS.  If you do not feel comfortable having your cloud account credentials stored on a 3rd party website, you can delete/edit the keys you stored on my application or user Azure/AWS to reset your key(s) after use.</p>

<h3>Getting Started with SASE</h3>

<p>1. You will need to login/register on the website with an email address and password.</p>
<p>2. Click the "MVC SASE" tab at the top left to enter the storage explorer application.</p>
<p>3. If it is your first time using the application you will need to create a new storage account to use the explorer.  Click the "Create New Storage Accont" link to do so.</p>
<p>4. From the storage account page, click the "Storage Explore" link on the account that you wish to explore.</p>

<h3>Questions or Comments?</h3>

<p>This project was created to build and demonstrate a basic cloud project.  As such there are new features being added periodically based on the developer's (me) desire to learn and present new ideas based on cloud technologies.  If there are any questions, comments or suggestions that you may have you can email me directly at: ingramsh829 @ gmail .com</p>
